# Transformer_on_Medical_Imaging
The success of transformers in the Natural language processing(NLP) domain, it has shift it’s focus in the Computer vision task. Due to which numerous research are being carried out along with creation of different models either in hybrid form(combination of transformers and Deep Neural Network) or in the pure form. In this project we are trying to dive deep into the implementation of Vision transformer(ViT),trying to understand it’s architecture for the Binary Classification task and finally implementing it. The domain that we choose for this project is Medical domain where we will be utilizing all the three color channels which is different from traditional computer vision task. Finally, we will be evaluating the Transformer model with other state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network like ResNet50 and pre-trained ResNet50.
